I've always been passionate about art and technology and the web provides me with the perfect platform for pursuing both of these interests. Most of my work has been in the front-end, but I also have experience in design and back-end development. When I'm not working, I'm either cooking, drawing, or learning about the latest web trends and technologies. I'm currently available for hire, so if you're looking for a front-end developer or someone to do contract work, I'd be more than happy to talk.
