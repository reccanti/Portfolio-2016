## Technology Used

- Canvas
- Node
- openFrameworks (C++)
- SocketIO

## Role

- Lead Developer

*Inspire* was a music discovery installation that my team and I developed for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of our senior project. Users could select 2 artists from a touch display, and the installation would then calculate a similar artist based on those choices. From there, it would generate an audio and video display that would be projected onto a multi-faced spire.

This was the biggest project I had worked on up to this point, and it was my first time leading one. I had just wrapped up work on [ADS]({% post_url 2015-10-26-ADS %}) and [learnVCS]({% post_url 2016-2-28-learnVCS %}), and I learned a lot about project managment from them. I wanted to see if I could apply the skills I learned, so I volunteered to be the lead developer.

## Managing a large project

The most valuable skill I learned when managing the project was **getting the job done.** On previous projects, I only had to work on a few small sections at a time. As a manager, I had to focus on the big picture. figuring out what features needed to be finished, and what could be cut if necessary.

This affected the technology we worked with. We only had about 15 weeks to come up with an idea for a project and build it to completion, so we tried to use existing tools and systems. We discovered we could use the Spotify and Echonest APIs for the music discovery. We also tried to use technology we were familiar with, like Node and the HTML Canvas.

## Working with a team

Another aspect of the project that was new to me was working with a large team. Up until that point, the biggest teams I had worked in were about 4-5 people. This time, I was working with 6 designers and leading a team of four developers, each with different skills. With all of these people, we had to find a way to make sure we knew who was working on what.

I handled this by dividing the project into different sections and delegating them to different developers. One person worked on creating the interactive display, another person handled the backend, gathering data from APIs and sending it out. Two of us handled the openframeworks/madmapper display since none of us had any experience with these technologies.

From there, it was simple to communicate what we needed from the designers. They knew who was in charge of each aspect of the project and could give them the specs they needed. As lead developer, I was also in charge of connecting other people as a last-ditch effort.

## Presenting the project

The project was presented at ImagineRIT, a festival held every Spring at the Rochester Institute of Technology. From there, we had to switch gears from working on the project to presenting it. It drew a pretty big crowd, and people seemed to like using it. That being said we also occasionally had to fix errors on the fly. Forgunately, we didn't have any serious issues, and we were able to quickly resolve most of them.
