## The Project

The Administrative Data System (ADS) was a web application consisting of two parts: **a database of student records and a web client to access it**. It was developed for RIT's Golisano College of Computing and Information Science as a means of managing student records and performing other administrative duties. 

I worked on this project during the second phase of development along with three other people. Our job was to maintain the system and add new sections and features as needed.

## Tasks

### Updating the Door Key Management System

The Door Key managament system allowed the department to keep track of who had access to a room at any given time. ADS was already keeping track of this, but it was doing it across a couple of different modules. My job was to group the functionality into a single module and update its appearance to match the rest of the site.

One of the challenges I encountered in this section was creating a filter system for the keys. We needed to be able to filter keys by whether or not they were currently active, but the table system we were using did not support custom filters.

In order to make this system more flexible in the future, I created a filter object. This object held an array of self-contained filter components. The filter object would render its components, but each component was responsible for supplying a render function and applying its filter to the form. I created generic checkbox and radio filters and ported over the search bar and the alphabet filter, making them more consistent with the new system.

### Creating a Prospective Students Module

Most of the work I did on ADS involved accessing data from the database, but the Prospective Students Module required me to create tables in the database. Two of the things they wanted to know about prospective students was what majors they were considering and what other colleges they were applying to. It only called for three of each, but I thought hard-coding that in would not be the best long-term solution. If the requirements were to change at some point in the future, it would be much more difficult to update the system.

My solution was to create three tables: a Prospective Student table, a Prospective Colleges table, and a Prospective Majors table. The Prospective Student table wasn't aware of the other two tables, but those two tables kept track of the student's ID as a foreign key.

This led to some issues when it came to accessing the data on the server. Most of the scripts we were using only expected to draw data from a single table. I had to create my own script to compile the data from the three tables into a single object that the application could more easily interact with.
