The Administrative Data System (ADS) is a PHP web application that was developed for RIT’s College of Computing and Information Sciences. I, and a team of 2 other people, came on to the project during the second phase of development. At that point, most of the major features had been implemented. Our goal was to maintain the system and add new features when needed. 

## Day-to-Day Activities
This project involved a lot work in both the front-end and the back-end. AJAX played a large role in the application and a large part of the job was setting up forms so that their data could be easily be parsed, serialized, and processed via jQuery.

When interacting with the back-end, we needed to be able to retrieve information from the database, as well as add information to it. We used MeekroDB to connect to the database and execute custom SQL queries. 

Another part of the job was rewriting pages to follow a consistent style. We rewrote the HTML for these pages so that they could be styled using a common CSS file.

## Filter System

One big feature that I implemented was a modular filter system. Most sections on the site used a table system like the one above for displaying entries. The tables would quickly become cluttered, and the User needed a way to easily sift through this data.

The original filter for the table consisted of two fields: filter by letter and search. Each of these options worked well on their own, but they didn't scale well when we tried to add additional filters. To solve this, I created a standard filter object.

The filter object was a holder for different filter components. The user would add compenents to the object with set parameters. After they were all added, the user would just call a render function to draw it on the screen. I implemented generic radio and checkbox filters, and I also ported over the search field and the letter filter. Functionally they were the same, but the CSS was changed so that they scaled better when additional fields were added and used conventions similar to the other elements.
