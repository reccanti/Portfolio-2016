I like to work on a lot of small projects in my spare time. Sometimes it's to learn a new concept or skill, and sometimes it's just for fun! Here are the ones that I'm most proud of.

## Dance All Night

I made this demo as part of the [Nightly Sea Creatures](http://codepen.io/collection/neJVwm/) CodePen Creative Challenge and it was later featured on CodePen's front page. One of the things I had been reading about at the time was web animation, and I wanted to try it out. I created the creature in Sketch and then exported it as a series of SVG componenets. To make it "dance" I animated it using the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP).

## Rainbow

This was another CodePen Creative Challenge: [Rainbow Text Weekend](http://codepen.io/collection/nxKPzY/). With this one, I wanted to experiment with some of the more advanced features of Sass. The letters are just divs. They have different background colors and different transition delays, but are otherwise similar. To make use of this, I created a map of colors and their values, then iterated over each of them to generate each of the classes.

## Wave

Wave is a pen that I made to learn more about the \<canvas\> element. My goal was to render a complex animation as quickly as possible. I did this by rendering the shape to a buffer. The basic shape consisted of a large ring with an outer black circle on the edge. Instead of drawing both of these shapes at each point, I drew it once on a hidden "buffer" canvas and copied the image data. After that, I could draw it again at every other point, slightly modifying the rotation each time. The result is much more efficient, running smoothly at full screen while [the original attempt](http://codepen.io/reccanti/pen/YwYQab) struggles to run in a small window.
