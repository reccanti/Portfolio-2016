I like to work on a lot of small projects in my spare time. Sometimes it's to learn a new concept or skill, and sometimes it's just for fun! Here are the ones that I'm most proud of.

## Dance All Night

This is one that I made as part of the [Nightly Sea Creatures](http://codepen.io/collection/neJVwm/) CodePen Creative Challenge. One of the things I had been reading a lot about was web animation, and I wanted to try something out with that. I created the creature in Sketch and then exported it as a series of SVG componenets. To make it "dance" I animated it using GreenSock TweenMax.

## Rainbow

This was another CodePen Creative Challenge: [Rainbow Text Weekend](http://codepen.io/collection/nxKPzY/). With this one, I wanted to experiment with some of the more advanced features of Sass. The letters are just divs. They have different background colors and different transition delays, but are otherwise similar. To make use of this, I created a map of colors and their values, then iterated over each of them to generate each of the classes.
